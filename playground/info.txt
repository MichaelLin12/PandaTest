nm -nCpA <obj file> --> gets symbols from obj file(the file that is only compiled with the -c flag)
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Directory-Options.html -> useful for searching the whole file
-c flag in gcc only compiles and does not link
-I flag for include at the end of include path for compile time
-iquote for include at the beginning of include path for compile time
-O0 for no inline
objcopy --redefine-sym testing=testing_real file.o

Example 2 does not work!!
Changing the symbols only works if  they are in different
compilation units. ie. .o files. If this is the case then we can 
just compile with the -c flag and choose the test copy of the compilation unit always.

There are cases where you call functions in a single compilation unit and we have to deal
with that. I can write code that will run on build that will automatically copy over the function.
The idea would be to 1. find the function signature in the given file and 2. run a simple stack algo
to detect the closing parantheses and  3. use the line number to replace.

The idea would be to use macros to define which file to look at and then find the file in linux.
This is going to be annoyingly difficult

Defining TEST SIGNATURES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

we want a --->
test case -> TEST_SET(NAME, TEST NAMES)
test set -> TEST(NAME){}

Off the top of my head, there doesn't seem to be a good way to be like oh lets call this function.
We should instead use MACROS like Google does. THE ABOVE SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR A SMALL SCALE.
